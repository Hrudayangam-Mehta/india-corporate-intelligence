 * which means the pattern can never fail to be found.
 *
 * A computed motif can come out empty. That is the point.
 *
 * Every template carries:
 *   - a census with a real denominator (a numerator alone is not a finding),
 *   - a z-score against a degree-preserving null model (hubs and short paths are
 *     compulsory in networks like this — see Milo et al. 2002),
 *   - a mandatory innocent reading, and
